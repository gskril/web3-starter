## Opinionated Web3 Project Starter Template

This is a starter template for building web3 projects using my preferred stack:

- Next.js
- Styled Components
- Styled JSX (with Sass support)
- Viem
- Wagmi
- RainbowKit
- Plausible Analytics

It also includes hooks that I tend to use often and my eslint/prettier configuration to keep things consistent.
